# wtsQMD

An R package with functions and files to facilitate creating documents 
using [Quarto](https://quarto.org); particularly for producing html and pdf output 
from the same files when tables and figures in the html version should be "in line" 
while they should be after the main text in pdf documents.

## Installation
